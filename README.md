# user-profile-customization
This is a repository to showcase my QA skills. I wanted to show what I could do when a new feature arrives, the test plan I would write, and the thought process and steps I would take.  
I asked ChatGPT to give me a sample design doc for a new feature that I could create a test plan for. ChatGPT created the "user-profile-customization" feature with a sample design doc.

## References
- See `User_profile_design_doc.md` for the design doc ChatGPT gave me.
- See `User_profile_test_plan.md` for the test plan that I created.
- See `Steps_and_thought_process.md` for the thought process and steps I took to create the test plan.

## For more QA & Testing work
- If you want to see some automated tests I write, in action, please take a look at project_flashcards. (TODO)
- If you would like to see more Test plans and Test case creation from me, [this](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1P2xgfKWNMKwNyGtOqxGIYsXT064-n5Zxu-NIJM2sqRE/edit?usp=sharing) is an interview assessment I did for any website of my choosing. This shows more thought process and many more different types of testing and test cases I could think of.
